# Jacob Zea's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In this project I wanted to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScrips, and Git in order for me to be succsessful in my Coding Bootcamp. I did this project to better understand how these computer languages work and how they interact with one another. In doing this project it helped solve the problem of me not knowing anything about computer languages and has taught me some of the basics of these languages.
